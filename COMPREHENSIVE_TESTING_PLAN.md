## üö® **CRITICAL REMINDERS**

1. **USE BROWSER ONLY** - No curl/API shortcuts
2. **CLICK EVERY LINK** - Don't assume anything works
3. **CREATE GITHUB ISSUES IMMEDIATELY** - When problems found
4. **TEST REAL STATIONS** - KEXP, WNYC, WFMU are mandatory
5. **DOCUMENT EVERYTHING** - Every test result matters
6. **BREAK THE SYSTEM** - QA mindset, find problems

**"If it's not tested like a real user with real browser clicks, it's not tested!"**
