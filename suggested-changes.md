Here are some suggestions for improving the provided code:

### `backend/services/recording_service.py`

1.  **Error Handling and Logging:**
    *   **More Specific Exceptions:** Instead of broad `except Exception as e:`, consider catching more specific exceptions (e.g., `sqlalchemy.exc.SQLAlchemyError`, `subprocess.CalledProcessError`, `FileNotFoundError`). This allows for more precise error handling and debugging.
    *   **Consistent Error Reporting:** Ensure that all error paths consistently update the `result` dictionary with meaningful error messages.
    *   **Logging Levels:** Use appropriate logging levels (`debug`, `info`, `warning`, `error`, `critical`) for different types of messages. For instance, `logger.error` should be used for actual failures, while `logger.warning` might be for non-critical issues like duplicate recordings.
    *   **`exc_info=True` in `logger.error`:** This is good practice for logging exceptions, as it includes traceback information. Ensure it's used consistently where appropriate.

2.  **Database Interactions:**
    *   **Session Management:** While `SessionLocal()` is used, ensure that `db.close()` is always called, even in error scenarios. The `finally` block helps, but consider using a `with` statement for SQLAlchemy sessions (`with SessionLocal() as db:`) for automatic session management, which is more robust.
    *   **Duplicate Prevention Logic:** The `_save_recording_to_database` method has logic to handle duplicate entries. While it attempts to re-query after a commit error, relying on string matching for `commit_error` (`"Duplicate entry" in str(commit_error)`) is brittle. It's better to catch specific SQLAlchemy exceptions for integrity errors (e.g., `sqlalchemy.exc.IntegrityError`).
    *   **Transaction Management:** For `_save_recording_to_database`, explicitly define a transaction block if multiple database operations need to be atomic. The current `db.commit()` and `db.rollback()` are good, but a `with db.begin():` block can simplify this.

3.  **File System Operations:**
    *   **Permissions (`os.system`):** The `os.system` calls for `chown` and `chmod` in `__init__` are problematic. These operations should ideally be handled by the Docker container's entrypoint script or Dockerfile, ensuring the correct permissions are set *before* the application starts. Running them at runtime can lead to security vulnerabilities and unexpected behavior in a containerized environment.
    *   **Path Handling:** Using `pathlib.Path` is good. Ensure consistency in using `Path` objects versus `os.path.join` and string paths. `Path` objects offer more Pythonic and safer ways to manipulate paths.

4.  **Code Clarity and Modularity:**
    *   **`_recording_job` Duration:** The `_recording_job` function hardcodes `duration = 3600`. It states "Calculate recording duration based on show settings or default to 1 hour" but doesn't actually retrieve the show's duration setting. This should be implemented to respect show-specific durations.
    *   **Magic Numbers:** `3600` (seconds in an hour) and `2048` (bytes/sec for quality validation) are magic numbers. Define them as constants at the top of the file for better readability and maintainability.
    *   **`test_recording_service` Imports:** The import of `test_recording_service` functions directly into `EnhancedRecordingService` suggests a tight coupling. If these are truly utility functions, they might belong in a shared `utils` module, or `EnhancedRecordingService` could inherit from a base class that provides these.

### `backend/services/schedule_parser.py`

1.  **Robustness of Parsing:**
    *   **Ambiguity in Natural Language:** Natural language parsing is inherently complex. The current regex patterns might struggle with more varied inputs (e.g., "every other Monday", "first Tuesday of the month", "Monday, Wednesday, and Friday"). Consider using a more sophisticated natural language processing (NLP) library if more complex schedule patterns are expected.
    *   **Timezone Handling:** The parser doesn't explicitly handle timezones in the input text (e.g., "7 PM EST"). While the `RecordingScheduler` uses `America/New_York`, the parser itself assumes local time or no timezone context. If schedules can be specified with timezones, the parser needs to account for this.
    *   **Error Messages:** Improve the specificity of error messages. "Could not parse time from schedule" is generic; it could indicate *which* part of the time parsing failed.

2.  **Regex Patterns:**
    *   **Order of Patterns:** The order of `time_patterns` matters. Ensure that more specific patterns (e.g., `HH:MM am/pm`) are tried before more general ones (e.g., `HH am/pm` or `HH`).
    *   **Edge Cases:** Test with edge cases like "12 AM", "12 PM", "00:00", "23:59" to ensure correct parsing.

3.  **`_extract_days` Logic:**
    *   **Multiple Day Specifications:** The current logic for `_extract_days` might not correctly handle combinations like "Monday, Wednesday, Friday" if they are not explicitly listed in `days_map` as a single entry. It currently appends individual days but might not combine them optimally if a more complex pattern is present.
    *   **"Monday through Friday":** The `_extract_days` function has a comment "Record Monday through Friday at 6 PM" in `test_schedule_parser` but the `_extract_days` function itself doesn't explicitly parse "through". It relies on "weekday" or "workday". This could be made more explicit.

4.  **`_generate_description`:**
    *   **Clarity for Multiple Days:** For `days_str`, when there are multiple days (e.g., "every Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday"), the current output is "every Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday". While functional, consider using Oxford commas or slightly different phrasing for better grammar if desired.

5.  **`validate_cron_expression`:**
    *   **Completeness:** The `_validate_cron_field` function provides basic validation. A full cron expression validator would be more complex, handling step values (`*/5`), lists (`1,3,5`), and special characters. For the current use case, it might be sufficient, but be aware of its limitations.

### `frontend/includes/functions.php`

1.  **Security:**
    *   **`shell_exec`:** The `callPythonService` function uses `shell_exec` to run Python scripts. This is a significant security risk if the `$service`, `$method`, or `$data` parameters can be influenced by user input without strict sanitization. An attacker could inject malicious commands.
        *   **Recommendation:** Avoid `shell_exec` for executing backend services. Instead, consider:
            *   **HTTP API:** Expose Python services as a proper HTTP API (e.g., using Flask/FastAPI) and call them from PHP using `curl` or PHP's built-in HTTP functions. This provides better separation, security, and scalability.
            *   **Message Queues:** For asynchronous tasks, use a message queue (e.g., RabbitMQ, Redis Queue) where PHP enqueues tasks and Python workers consume them.
    *   **Input Sanitization:** While `h($string)` (htmlspecialchars) is used for HTML output, ensure *all* user inputs are properly sanitized and validated *before* being used in database queries, file paths, or `shell_exec` commands. PHP's filter functions (`filter_var`, `filter_input`) are useful for this.
    *   **CSRF Token:** The CSRF protection is good, but ensure it's applied to *all* state-changing forms and API endpoints.

2.  **Error Handling:**
    *   **`callPythonService` Error Details:** The `callPythonService` function returns generic errors like "Service not found" or "Invalid response from service." It would be more helpful to include the actual `stderr` from the Python script or the `json_last_error_msg()` for better debugging.
    *   **Database Errors:** The `index.php` catches `Exception $e` for database errors. While it displays a generic message, logging the full exception details on the server-side is crucial.

3.  **Maintainability and Best Practices:**
    *   **Constants for Paths:** Hardcoded paths like `/var/radiograb/recordings/` and `/logos/` should be defined as constants or configuration variables to avoid repetition and simplify changes.
    *   **`getStationLogo` Logic:** The logic for `getStationLogo` is clear.
    *   **`generateSocialMediaIcons`:** The `platform_order` array is good for consistent display.
    *   **`getVersionNumber`:** Reading from a file is a reasonable approach.
    *   **Type Hinting:** While PHP 7.x supports type hinting, it's not consistently used in this file. Adding scalar type hints and return type declarations can improve code readability and help catch errors.

### `frontend/public/index.php`

1.  **Separation of Concerns:**
    *   **PHP Logic in HTML:** The `index.php` file mixes PHP logic (database queries, data fetching) directly with HTML presentation. This makes the code harder to read, test, and maintain.
    *   **Recommendation:**
        *   **Controller/View Pattern:** Separate the data fetching and processing logic into a dedicated PHP "controller" file or function. The `index.php` would then primarily be a "view" that receives data and renders it.
        *   **Templating Engine:** For more complex UIs, consider a templating engine (e.g., Twig, Blade) to further separate PHP logic from HTML.

2.  **Database Queries:**
    *   **Direct SQL:** The use of direct SQL queries (`$db->fetchOne`, `$db->fetchAll`) is common in smaller PHP applications but can become unwieldy.
    *   **Recommendation:** For larger applications, consider an Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) like Doctrine or Eloquent (from Laravel) to manage database interactions, which can improve code organization, security (prepared statements), and testability.
    *   **Prepared Statements:** Ensure that all database queries that involve user input (even indirectly) use prepared statements to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities. The `database.php` file (not provided) should handle this.

3.  **Error Display:**
    *   **User-Friendly Errors:** While displaying `$error` is helpful, ensure that sensitive database error details are *not* exposed directly to the end-user in a production environment. Log them server-side and show a generic, user-friendly message.

4.  **Client-Side JavaScript:**
    *   **API Endpoint for Next Recordings:** The `fetch('/api/show-management.php?action=get_next_recordings&limit=3')` call is good for asynchronous loading.
    *   **Error Handling in `fetch`:** The `catch` block for the `fetch` call is good for handling network errors.
    *   **Dynamic HTML Generation:** The `displayNextRecordings` function dynamically generates HTML using template literals. This is generally acceptable for small components, but for more complex UIs, a client-side framework (React, Vue, Alpine.js) might be considered for better structure and state management.
    *   **`refreshNextRecordings`:** This function simply calls `loadNextRecordings()`, which is fine.

Overall, the project has a clear structure and implements many features. The primary areas for improvement revolve around enhancing security (especially with `shell_exec`), improving code organization and maintainability (separating concerns in PHP), and refining error handling.
