# RadioGrab Project Summary & Goals

## Project Overview
**RadioGrab** is a comprehensive radio station recording and management system - essentially a "Radio Recording System for radio stations." It automatically discovers, schedules, and records radio shows from streaming stations, supports user playlist uploads with comprehensive metadata management, and makes everything available via RSS feeds for podcast consumption.

## Core Functionality
- **Station Discovery**: Automatically crawl radio station websites to discover streaming URLs, logos, schedules, and metadata
- **Show Scheduling**: Import show schedules and convert them to automated recording schedules
- **Automated Recording**: Record radio shows using streamripper based on cron schedules
- **Playlist Upload System**: User audio file uploads with multi-format support and drag & drop track ordering
- **MP3 Metadata Management**: Comprehensive metadata writing for all recordings and uploads (artist=show name, album=station name, etc.)
- **Logo & Social Media System**: Local logo storage with Facebook fallback and social media integration for 10+ platforms
- **RSS Feed Generation**: Create podcast-style RSS feeds of recorded shows and playlists
- **Web Management Interface**: Complete web UI for managing stations, shows, recordings, and playlists with visual social media integration

## Technical Architecture ‚ö†Ô∏è DOCKER CONTAINERS ‚ö†Ô∏è

## Development Workflow
1. **Local development**: Make changes in `/Users/mjb9/scripts/radiograb/`
2. **Version control**: Git repository with commits to GitHub
3. **Deployment**: 
   - Copy files to server via scp as `radiograb` user: `scp file.py radiograb@167.71.84.143:/tmp/`
   - Copy to containers: `docker cp /tmp/file.py radiograb-container:/opt/radiograb/path/`
   - Restart containers: `docker compose restart` (in `/opt/radiograb/`)
4. **Testing**: Verify functionality on live server at radiograb.svaha.com

**ALL Python scripts MUST be executed using the virtual environment:**
- **Correct**: `cd /opt/radiograb && PYTHONPATH=/opt/radiograb /opt/radiograb/venv/bin/python script.py`
- **Wrong**: `python3 script.py` (missing dependencies)
- **PHP Integration**: When calling Python from PHP, always use full venv path
- **Container Exec**: `docker exec container /opt/radiograb/venv/bin/python script.py`

## Server Configuration
- **User**: `radiograb` user owns and manages Docker containers
- **Project Directory**: `/opt/radiograb/` (owned by `radiograb:radiograb`)

- **Database**: `database/schema.sql` with playlist support extensions
- **Config**: `docker-compose.yml`, `.env`, `requirements.txt` with new dependencies

## Success Metrics
- **Station addition time**: Should take <5 minutes from URL to working recordings
