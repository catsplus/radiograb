2025-07-30 00:25:00 - GENERIC ARCHITECTURE v2.11.0 - CRITICAL ARCHITECTURE OVERHAUL: ✅ Removed ALL station-specific hardcoded logic from parsers - _parse_weru_json_schedule → _parse_iso_timestamp_json_schedule, _parse_wyso_schedule → _parse_show_links_schedule. ✅ Generic StreamTheWorld HD2 fallback logic (not WYSO-specific). ✅ Added Pillow dependency for logo processing. ✅ All parsers now work for any station with similar formats - no station-specific code remains in production functions. System now follows proper generic architecture principles for unlimited scalability.
