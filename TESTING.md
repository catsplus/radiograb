# Testing Guidelines for RadioGrab Development

## üéØ Overview

This document establishes comprehensive testing requirements for all RadioGrab development work. Every code change must be thoroughly tested using real user workflows to ensure reliability and quality.

**üèÜ TESTING PHILOSOPHY: "Break the System, Find the Victory!"**
Your goal is to BREAK the site and FIND errors - every bug found is a VICTORY! Approach testing like a Quality Assurance expert whose job is to find problems. Test like an adversarial user trying to break things.

## üõ†Ô∏è **TESTING ENVIRONMENT & PERMISSIONS**

### **üåê Browser Access**
- **You HAVE Chrome/Chromium browser access** - Use it! No excuses for skipping browser testing
- **Available browsers:** Chrome via `/Applications/Google Chrome.app`
- **Browser automation:** Selenium WebDriver available for systematic testing
- **Command:** `open -a "Google Chrome" "https://radiograb.svaha.com"`

### **üö® TEST ENVIRONMENT - FULL DESTRUCTIVE PERMISSIONS**
- **This IS a test environment** - You have permission to break, delete, and modify anything
- **Delete data freely**: Stations, shows, recordings, users - test deletion functionality
- **Edit aggressively**: Modify existing data to test edge cases and validation
- **Create test data**: Add fake stations, shows, users as needed for testing
- **No data preservation required**: Break things to find problems

### **üîë ADMINISTRATIVE ACCESS**
- **Server Root Access**: `root@167.71.84.143` - Full system administration privileges
- **Database Direct Access**: MySQL root access for data manipulation and testing
- **Docker Management**: Full container restart, rebuild, and configuration access
- **File System**: Complete read/write access to all application files

### **üêõ GITHUB ISSUE MANAGEMENT**
- **Create Issues Immediately**: When ANY problem found during testing
- **You CAN create new labels**: Use `gh label create` for better organization
- **Available labels**: bug, enhancement, testing, ux, browser-testing, security, etc.
- **Your job is to FIND problems and CREATE issues** - NOT to fix them during testing
- **Move on after creating issue** - Don't get stuck trying to fix problems

### **üìù TESTING MANDATE**
**YOUR TESTING MISSION:**
1. **Find problems** through systematic browser testing
2. **Create GitHub issues immediately** for each problem found
3. **Document testing results** comprehensively  
4. **Move on to next test** - don't fix issues during testing phase
5. **Use full destructive testing** - this is a test environment

## üö® CRITICAL TESTING REQUIREMENTS

### **üî• MANDATORY: Test EVERYTHING - No Exceptions**
**YOU MUST TEST ALL LINKS, ALL PAGES, ALL FEATURES, AND ALL FAILURE SCENARIOS WITHOUT EXCEPTION.**

- **Test ALL navigation menu links** - click every single link in the main menu
- **Test ALL page functionality** - every button, form, modal, dropdown, filter, search
- **Test ALL user workflows** - complete end-to-end user journeys 
- **Test ALL interactive elements** - hover effects, clicks, form submissions, validations
- **Test ALL error conditions** - invalid inputs, missing data, network failures, edge cases
- **Test ALL form variations** - valid data, invalid data, missing data, malformed data
- **Test ALL discovery features** - enter real radio stations, test auto-discovery, test failures
- **DO NOT assume API calls working means the page works** - test the actual user interface
- **DO NOT skip any pages or features** - comprehensive means COMPREHENSIVE
- **ACTIVELY TRY TO BREAK THINGS** - test boundary conditions, unusual inputs, error scenarios

### **1. MANDATORY: Test as a Real User Using Chrome/Chromium Browser**
**üö® CRITICAL: ALL testing MUST be done through actual browser interaction - NO API testing shortcuts!**

- **Use the actual web browser interface at https://radiograb.svaha.com**
- **Follow complete user workflows from start to finish exactly as users would**
- **Never assume functionality works - verify it through actual browser clicks and form submissions**
- **Test using ONLY the same methods and interfaces that end users would use**
- **Click every single link and button on every page like a real user**
- **Fill out and submit every form with both valid and invalid data using browser forms**
- **Test real radio stations** (KEXP, WNYC, WFMU, local stations, etc.) **through the Add Station form**
- **Test edge cases** (empty forms, malicious input, broken URLs) **by typing them into browser forms**
- **Test discovery features** (auto-discovery buttons, manual entry, error handling) **by clicking buttons in browser**
- **Test all interactive elements** (modals, dropdowns, filters, search, pagination) **by interacting in browser**

**‚ùå DO NOT TEST:**
- Direct API endpoints with curl/Postman unless specifically testing API functionality
- Backend services directly via command line
- Database queries directly

**‚úÖ DO TEST:**
- Browser forms exactly as users fill them out
- Button clicks exactly as users click them  
- Navigation exactly as users navigate
- Real user workflows from start to finish

### **2. Systematic Page-by-Page Testing Protocol**
- **Test immediately after implementing each feature/fix**
- **Test ALL navigation links first** - ensure every menu item loads without errors
- **Test ALL page functionality** - forms, buttons, modals, filters, search, etc.
- **Test ALL workflows end-to-end** - complete user journeys from start to finish
- **Create GitHub issues for ALL problems found** - do not fix immediately
- **Continue testing other features** - complete full testing cycle before fixing
- **Fix ALL issues only after complete testing cycle**

### **3. Quality Assurance (QA) Testing Approach**
**Adopt the mindset of a professional QA tester whose job is to find problems:**

#### **üéØ QA Testing Strategy**
- **Adversarial Testing**: Try to break the system intentionally
- **Boundary Testing**: Test limits (very long inputs, special characters, edge cases)
- **User Experience Testing**: Test as different user types (new users, experienced users, admin users)
- **Error Path Testing**: Test all error conditions and recovery paths
- **Integration Testing**: Test how features work together
- **Regression Testing**: Ensure existing features still work after changes

#### **üîç Real-World Station Testing**
**MANDATORY: Test with real radio stations every time:**
- **KEXP.org** - Test JavaScript-heavy site with complex player
- **WNYC.org** - Test NPR affiliate with standard streaming
- **WFMU.org** - Test independent station with unique setup
- **wjffradio.org** - Test domain-only URL validation
- **Local college radio** - Test smaller stations with simpler sites
- **Broken/invalid URLs** - Test error handling with non-existent domains
- **Malformed URLs** - Test with invalid formats, special characters

#### **üî• GitHub Issue Creation Protocol** 
**CRITICAL: Every bug found must become a GitHub issue immediately - NO EXCEPTIONS:**

**When you find ANY problem during testing:**
1. **IMMEDIATELY create a GitHub issue** - do not wait, do not batch issues
2. **Document the exact problem** (URL, steps to reproduce, expected vs actual behavior)
3. **Use detailed reproduction steps** - include user workflow context
4. **Label the issue appropriately** - YOU CAN CREATE NEW LABELS as needed
5. **Continue testing other features** - do NOT fix immediately
6. **Move on to next test** - your job is to FIND problems, not fix them

**üö® MANDATORY: Create issues AS YOU GO during testing**
- **Create issue immediately when problem found** - don't wait until end of testing
- **One issue per bug** - don't combine multiple problems
- **Include priority assessment** (critical, high, medium, low)
- **Reference the testing session** in issue description
- **Use GitHub CLI**: `gh issue create --title "Problem title" --body "Detailed description" --label bug`

**üè∑Ô∏è GITHUB LABEL MANAGEMENT:**
- **You CAN create new labels**: `gh label create "label-name" --description "Description" --color "FF0000"`
- **Suggested labels**: testing, ux, browser-testing, security, forms, authentication, mobile, performance
- **Create labels as needed** to properly categorize issues found during testing

**Example GitHub Issue Format:**
```
Title: Add Station form breaks with KEXP.org - JavaScript streaming discovery fails

Description:
- URL: https://radiograb.svaha.com/add-station.php
- Steps to reproduce: 
  1. Enter "kexp.org" in website URL field
  2. Click "Discover" button
  3. Observe results
- Expected: Stream URL and station info discovered
- Actual: Discovery fails with no streaming URL found
- Impact: Major radio stations cannot be auto-discovered
- Priority: High
```

#### **üí• Destructive Testing Scenarios**
**üö® CRITICAL: Since this is a TEST ENVIRONMENT, be AGGRESSIVE - DELETE, EDIT, and BREAK everything!**

**Try to break things with these test cases:**

#### **üî• Form Security Testing**
- Submit forms with empty required fields
- Submit forms with extremely long text (1000+ characters)  
- Submit forms with HTML/JavaScript code: `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`
- Submit forms with SQL injection attempts: `'; DROP TABLE users; --`
- Submit forms with special characters (quotes, semicolons, Unicode, null bytes)
- Test file upload vulnerabilities (if applicable)

#### **üóëÔ∏è Data Manipulation Testing (FULL DESTRUCTIVE PERMISSIONS)**
- **DELETE ANYTHING**: Stations, shows, recordings, users - test all deletion functionality
- **EDIT AGGRESSIVELY**: Modify existing data with malicious/extreme inputs to find validation gaps
- **CREATE TEST DATA**: Add fake stations, duplicate entries, malformed records
- **CORRUPT DATA INTENTIONALLY**: Try to break database constraints and data integrity
- **DIRECT DATABASE ACCESS**: Use MySQL root to insert/modify/delete data for testing
- **MODIFY SYSTEM FILES**: You have full file system access - test configuration edge cases
- **RESTART/REBUILD CONTAINERS**: Use root server access to test deployment scenarios

**üö® REMEMBER: This is a TEST ENVIRONMENT - BREAK EVERYTHING to find problems!**

#### **üîê Access Control Testing**
- Try to access protected pages without authentication
- Test with invalid IDs in URLs (/edit-station.php?id=999999)
- Try to access admin functions as regular user
- Test session hijacking scenarios
- Try to access other users' data

#### **‚ö° Performance & Stress Testing**
- Test concurrent operations (multiple form submissions)
- Submit forms rapidly to test rate limiting
- Upload large files (if applicable)
- Test with slow network connections
- Create excessive amounts of data to test limits

#### **üåê Browser & Client Testing**
- Test with JavaScript disabled
- Test with cookies disabled
- Test on different browsers and mobile devices
- Test with ad blockers and privacy extensions
- Test with browser developer tools modifications

**üéØ GOAL: Every system has limits - find them all!**

### **4. Production Environment Testing Requirements**
- **Always test on the live production site** (https://radiograb.svaha.com)
- **Use the deployed version, not just local development**
- **Verify changes work in the actual Docker container environment**
- **Test with real data and real user scenarios**
- **Test both authenticated and unauthenticated user flows**

### **üö® CRITICAL: File Deployment Issues Protocol**
**When ANY error indicates incorrect file deployment (parse errors, missing functions, etc.):**

1. **IMMEDIATELY stop all testing**
2. **Perform FULL deployment** - `./deploy-from-git.sh` (NOT --quick)
3. **Wait for complete container rebuild** (10+ minutes if needed)
4. **Verify all containers are healthy** before continuing
5. **NEVER use shortcuts when deployment issues detected**
6. **Only continue testing after FULL system restart**

**Examples of deployment-related errors that trigger FULL rebuild:**
- PHP Parse errors (syntax errors in deployed files)
- Function redeclaration errors  
- Missing function/class errors
- File not found errors for files that exist in repo
- Any error suggesting files weren't properly updated

## üß™ Comprehensive Testing Workflows

### **Before Starting Development**
1. **Understand the Current State**
   - Test existing functionality before making changes
   - Document current behavior
   - Identify potential areas of impact

### **During Development** 
1. **Test Each Component**
   - Implement one feature/fix at a time
   - Test immediately after each change
   - Verify both new and existing functionality
   - Fix issues before proceeding

### **After Implementation**
1. **Complete User Journey Testing**
   - Test the entire user workflow end-to-end
   - Include all relevant user personas and scenarios
   - Test error conditions and edge cases
   - Verify integration with existing features

### **Before Deployment**
1. **Final Verification**
   - Test all changes on production environment
   - Verify no regressions in existing functionality
   - Confirm all requirements are met
   - Document any known limitations or issues

## üìù Testing Documentation Requirements

### **For Each Feature/Fix**
Document the following:

```markdown
## Testing Performed

### ‚úÖ Test Cases Executed
- [List specific tests performed]
- [Include both positive and negative test cases]
- [Note any edge cases tested]

### üêõ Issues Found and Fixed
- [Document any bugs discovered during testing]
- [Explain how each issue was resolved]

### üöÄ Production Verification
- [Confirm functionality works on live site]
- [Include specific URLs tested]
- [Note any browser-specific considerations]
```

## üö® Common Testing Failures to Avoid

### **‚ùå Don't Do This:**
- Assume form validation works without testing invalid inputs
- Test only the "happy path" without error conditions  
- Make changes without verifying on production site
- Test components in isolation without integration testing
- Skip testing of existing functionality after changes
- Rely on code review alone without functional testing

### **‚úÖ Do This Instead:**
- Test both valid and invalid inputs thoroughly
- Include error conditions and edge cases in testing
- Always verify functionality on the live production site
- Test the complete user workflow from start to finish
- Verify existing features still work after changes
- Combine code review with comprehensive functional testing

## üí° Remember

**"If it's not tested in production with real user workflows, it's not done."**

**"Every bug found during testing is a victory that prevents user-facing problems!"**

Quality software requires comprehensive testing. Taking time to test thoroughly prevents user-facing bugs and maintains system reliability. Every bug caught in testing is a bug that doesn't impact users.

**üö® CRITICAL REMINDER: Testing is only complete when ALL interactive elements have been clicked, ALL forms submitted with valid/invalid data, and ALL real radio stations tested through the actual browser interface.**
