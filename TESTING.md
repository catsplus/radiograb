# Testing Guidelines for RadioGrab Development

## üéØ Overview

This document establishes comprehensive testing requirements for all RadioGrab development work. Every code change must be thoroughly tested using real user workflows to ensure reliability and quality.

**üèÜ TESTING PHILOSOPHY: "Break the System, Find the Victory!"**
Your goal is to BREAK the site and FIND errors - every bug found is a VICTORY! Approach testing like a Quality Assurance expert whose job is to find problems. Test like an adversarial user trying to break things.

## üö® CRITICAL TESTING REQUIREMENTS

### **üî• MANDATORY: Test EVERYTHING - No Exceptions**
**YOU MUST TEST ALL LINKS, ALL PAGES, ALL FEATURES, AND ALL FAILURE SCENARIOS WITHOUT EXCEPTION.**

- **Test ALL navigation menu links** - click every single link in the main menu
- **Test ALL page functionality** - every button, form, modal, dropdown, filter, search
- **Test ALL user workflows** - complete end-to-end user journeys 
- **Test ALL interactive elements** - hover effects, clicks, form submissions, validations
- **Test ALL error conditions** - invalid inputs, missing data, network failures, edge cases
- **Test ALL form variations** - valid data, invalid data, missing data, malformed data
- **Test ALL discovery features** - enter real radio stations, test auto-discovery, test failures
- **DO NOT assume API calls working means the page works** - test the actual user interface
- **DO NOT skip any pages or features** - comprehensive means COMPREHENSIVE
- **ACTIVELY TRY TO BREAK THINGS** - test boundary conditions, unusual inputs, error scenarios

### **1. Always Test as a Real User Using Chrome/Chromium Browser**
- Use the actual web browser interface at https://radiograb.svaha.com
- Follow complete user workflows from start to finish  
- Never assume functionality works - verify it through actual usage
- Test using the same methods and interfaces that end users would use
- **Click every single link and button on every page**
- **Fill out and submit every form with both valid and invalid data**
- **Test real radio stations** (KEXP, WNYC, WFMU, local stations, etc.)
- **Test edge cases** (empty forms, malicious input, broken URLs, non-existent stations)
- **Test discovery features** (auto-discovery buttons, manual entry, error handling)
- **Test all interactive elements** (modals, dropdowns, filters, search, pagination)

### **2. Systematic Page-by-Page Testing Protocol**
- **Test immediately after implementing each feature/fix**
- **Test ALL navigation links first** - ensure every menu item loads without errors
- **Test ALL page functionality** - forms, buttons, modals, filters, search, etc.
- **Test ALL workflows end-to-end** - complete user journeys from start to finish
- **Create GitHub issues for ALL problems found** - do not fix immediately
- **Continue testing other features** - complete full testing cycle before fixing
- **Fix ALL issues only after complete testing cycle**

### **3. Quality Assurance (QA) Testing Approach**
**Adopt the mindset of a professional QA tester whose job is to find problems:**

#### **üéØ QA Testing Strategy**
- **Adversarial Testing**: Try to break the system intentionally
- **Boundary Testing**: Test limits (very long inputs, special characters, edge cases)
- **User Experience Testing**: Test as different user types (new users, experienced users, admin users)
- **Error Path Testing**: Test all error conditions and recovery paths
- **Integration Testing**: Test how features work together
- **Regression Testing**: Ensure existing features still work after changes

#### **üîç Real-World Station Testing**
**MANDATORY: Test with real radio stations every time:**
- **KEXP.org** - Test JavaScript-heavy site with complex player
- **WNYC.org** - Test NPR affiliate with standard streaming
- **WFMU.org** - Test independent station with unique setup
- **wjffradio.org** - Test domain-only URL validation
- **Local college radio** - Test smaller stations with simpler sites
- **Broken/invalid URLs** - Test error handling with non-existent domains
- **Malformed URLs** - Test with invalid formats, special characters

#### **üî• GitHub Issue Creation Protocol** 
**CRITICAL: Every bug found must become a GitHub issue immediately:**

**When you find ANY problem during testing:**
1. **Stop testing immediately**
2. **Document the exact problem** (URL, steps to reproduce, expected vs actual behavior)
3. **Create a GitHub issue** with detailed reproduction steps
4. **Label the issue appropriately** (bug, enhancement, critical, etc.)
5. **Continue testing other features** - do NOT fix immediately
6. **Only fix issues after completing full testing cycle**

**Example GitHub Issue Format:**
```
Title: Add Station form breaks with KEXP.org - JavaScript streaming discovery fails

Description:
- URL: https://radiograb.svaha.com/add-station.php
- Steps to reproduce: 
  1. Enter "kexp.org" in website URL field
  2. Click "Discover" button
  3. Observe results
- Expected: Stream URL and station info discovered
- Actual: Discovery fails with no streaming URL found
- Impact: Major radio stations cannot be auto-discovered
- Priority: High
```

#### **üí• Destructive Testing Scenarios**
**Try to break things with these test cases:**
- Submit forms with empty required fields
- Submit forms with extremely long text (1000+ characters)
- Submit forms with HTML/JavaScript code in text fields
- Submit forms with special characters (quotes, semicolons, Unicode)
- Try to access protected pages without authentication
- Test with invalid IDs in URLs (/edit-station.php?id=999999)
- Test with SQL injection attempts in form fields
- Test concurrent operations (multiple form submissions)
- Test network interruption scenarios (slow connections)

### **4. Production Environment Testing Requirements**
- **Always test on the live production site** (https://radiograb.svaha.com)
- **Use the deployed version, not just local development**
- **Verify changes work in the actual Docker container environment**
- **Test with real data and real user scenarios**
- **Test both authenticated and unauthenticated user flows**

### **üö® CRITICAL: File Deployment Issues Protocol**
**When ANY error indicates incorrect file deployment (parse errors, missing functions, etc.):**

1. **IMMEDIATELY stop all testing**
2. **Perform FULL deployment** - `./deploy-from-git.sh` (NOT --quick)
3. **Wait for complete container rebuild** (10+ minutes if needed)
4. **Verify all containers are healthy** before continuing
5. **NEVER use shortcuts when deployment issues detected**
6. **Only continue testing after FULL system restart**

**Examples of deployment-related errors that trigger FULL rebuild:**
- PHP Parse errors (syntax errors in deployed files)
- Function redeclaration errors  
- Missing function/class errors
- File not found errors for files that exist in repo
- Any error suggesting files weren't properly updated

## üß™ Comprehensive Testing Workflows

### **Before Starting Development**
1. **Understand the Current State**
   - Test existing functionality before making changes
   - Document current behavior
   - Identify potential areas of impact

### **During Development** 
1. **Test Each Component**
   - Implement one feature/fix at a time
   - Test immediately after each change
   - Verify both new and existing functionality
   - Fix issues before proceeding

### **After Implementation**
1. **Complete User Journey Testing**
   - Test the entire user workflow end-to-end
   - Include all relevant user personas and scenarios
   - Test error conditions and edge cases
   - Verify integration with existing features

### **Before Deployment**
1. **Final Verification**
   - Test all changes on production environment
   - Verify no regressions in existing functionality
   - Confirm all requirements are met
   - Document any known limitations or issues

## üìù Testing Documentation Requirements

### **For Each Feature/Fix**
Document the following:

```markdown
## Testing Performed

### ‚úÖ Test Cases Executed
- [List specific tests performed]
- [Include both positive and negative test cases]
- [Note any edge cases tested]

### üêõ Issues Found and Fixed
- [Document any bugs discovered during testing]
- [Explain how each issue was resolved]

### üöÄ Production Verification
- [Confirm functionality works on live site]
- [Include specific URLs tested]
- [Note any browser-specific considerations]
```

## üö® Common Testing Failures to Avoid

### **‚ùå Don't Do This:**
- Assume form validation works without testing invalid inputs
- Test only the "happy path" without error conditions  
- Make changes without verifying on production site
- Test components in isolation without integration testing
- Skip testing of existing functionality after changes
- Rely on code review alone without functional testing

### **‚úÖ Do This Instead:**
- Test both valid and invalid inputs thoroughly
- Include error conditions and edge cases in testing
- Always verify functionality on the live production site
- Test the complete user workflow from start to finish
- Verify existing features still work after changes
- Combine code review with comprehensive functional testing

---

## üí° Remember

**"If it's not tested in production with real user workflows, it's not done."**

Quality software requires comprehensive testing. Taking time to test thoroughly prevents user-facing bugs and maintains system reliability. Every bug caught in testing is a bug that doesn't impact users.
